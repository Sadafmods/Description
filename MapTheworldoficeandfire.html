<h1>The World of Ice and Fire</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a survival map with more than 100 castles and cities across the continents of Westeros, Essos and Sothoryos from A Song of Ice and Fire. This is a Bedrock map converted from the Original Java map by Maester Renan.</p>

<p>This map features all the cities/towns/villages/ruins (more than 100 at the least only in&nbsp;Westeros, all 9 free cities of Essos and even the Ruins of Valyria and other ruins around the map) that are listed on the official maps of a Song Ice &amp; Fire, including the continents of&nbsp;Essos&nbsp;and&nbsp;Sothoryos. You will start in the throne room of the Red Keep in King&#39;s Landing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The map was originally created by&nbsp;<a href="https://mcpedl.com/leaving/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.planetminecraft.com%2Fmember%2Fmaester_renan%2F&amp;blid=153" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong><u>Maester Renan</u></strong></a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;1.12.2&nbsp;version of the game, and converted into Bedrock version by me and I also edited every single house banners in Westeros (the conversion made all the banner colors negative) and edited a few locations like&nbsp;<strong>Dragonstone</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>King&#39;s Landing</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Castle Black</strong>, etc. The Map should work fine on any version from&nbsp;1.17&nbsp;and newer (I&#39;ve used some Deepslate and Amethyst around the map)<br />
