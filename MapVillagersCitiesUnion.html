<h1>Villager&#39;s Cities Union: The New Horizons [Part 1][Creation]</h1>

<p>Hello, guys! This is the first massive update of my creation map, based on the Default Minecraft world - Villagers cities Union, called &quot;The New Horizons&quot;. There are 2 whole new countries and rebuild of old territories. Let&#39;s take a look!</p>

<p>Map &quot;Villagers cities Union &quot; is a net of the towns and cities, connected with each other with railway system. This map based on default Minecraft world. Currently there are 3 countries on the map: Villagers cities Union(fully completed, but I plan to expand it), underground state-city Divergement and Intermarium(3 of 5 towns are ready for you to explore).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Villagers cities Union:</p>

<p>Big confederation of 17 towns: Downtown, Orangewood, Savannahtown, South Savannahtown, Birchtown, Minetown, New port, Deserttown, Swamp village, Jungle gates, Taigatown, Deserttown, Wheattown, Grasslandtown, Grassy village and river town.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Downtown city: Downtown is the capital of Villagers cities Union. In this update city was expanded and partly rebuilt. There are many buildings, port, skyscraper and lots of content to explore. Screenshots:</p>

<p>Intermarium</p>

<p>Intermarium is small country, situated between two seas. You can go there by North-South railway from Tavrida and Divergement. For now 3 of 5 towns are finished. Intermarium is mostly agrarian state, so many fields can be found there. Shorts description of towns</p>
