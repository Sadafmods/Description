<h1>Aerial Tramway</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is my second cable car addon. It adds an aerial tramway that looks more modern. It works the same way as before, long tap or right click on the minecart at the top to get in and shift to get out</p>

<p>. It still holds 6 players. This is the upgrated version, the overhaul of my previous &quot;cable car&quot; addon. This addon only adds the newer model, the one on the right. You can get the old cable car here: https://mcpedl.com/cable-car-addon-1/</p>

<p>The model is more detailed and just looks better. It is more modern.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just so you know, when i did the model, i was initiating to make a tent. thats why it kind of looks like one. This was supposed to be a tent but i had the idea of making it a cable car and there it is.</p>

<p>If you make a video, put the link to this page and credits.</p>

<p>Do not make this your own addon. Lots of work went into this, especially the model</p>

<p>Other than that, hope you guys enjoy the addon!</p>

<p>For now it is zip files, sorry, but i will change them soon</p>
