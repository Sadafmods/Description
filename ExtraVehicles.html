<p>The realistic animations of the horses and wagon will give you the feeling of riding a real horse-drawn carriage, while the well-designed UI will ensure that you have complete control over the wagon&#39;s movements. The wheels generate dust particles when moving, giving it a realistic touch. The 3D model of the wagon is detailed and well-textured, making it a visual treat to watch.<br />
<br />
Moreover, this add-on has a lot of high-quality realistic sounds that will immerse you in the game. Though currently, only LVL3 Horse Wagon is available, LVL1 and LVL2 are in the works and will be available soon.</p>

<h2><strong><u>UI Design</u></strong></h2>

<p><img src="https://api.mcpedl.com/storage/submissions/176409/images/extra-vehicles-addon_5.png" /></p>

<h4><strong><u>Description</u></strong>:</h4>

<p>This is the UI Design for Horse Wagon LVL3. It will show up when you try to open the inventory while riding the Wagon and have at least one chest in the Wagon.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

<h4><strong><u>Notice</u></strong>:</h4>

<p>You will see all the slots appeared even though you might only added one chest to the wagon. This is a problem that I can&#39;t fix it. It might look like its working But don&#39;t worry slots will only work if you added the right amount of chests.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong><u>Speed System</u></strong></h2>

<h4><strong><u>Description:</u></strong></h4>

<p>There is 6 speed levels in total. You can increase the wagon speed level by (right clicking/pressing button) while riding the wagon and moving.</p>

<p>When you increase the speed the Rope Wiping animation will be played.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong><u>Estimated Speeds in m/s:</u></strong></h4>

<p>player Sprinting = 6 m/s</p>

<p>Speed 1 = 0.5 m/s</p>

<p>Speed 2 = 1.0 m/s</p>

<p>Speed 3 = 2.9 m/s</p>

<p>Speed 4 = 5.8 m/s</p>

<p>Speed 5 = 8.8 m/s</p>

<p>Speed 6 = 11.7 m/s</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong><u>Notice:</u></strong></h4>

<p>-The Timer purpose is to decrease the Wagon speed by time (It is as if the horses slowing with time).</p>

<p>- Every time you increase speed a timer of 5s will start.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>- whenever the timer runs out, It reduce the speed level by -1.</p>

<p>- To reset the timer, whip the horses to increase the speed and reset the timer back.</p>

<p>- There is no timer running, when you are on speed 1.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong><u>Tip:</u></strong></h4>

<p>Spam on Wiping the horses when you reach speed 6, so that you maintain the same speed without any decrease in speed.</p>
