<h1>Builder Villager (V2 Update!) | by Aladdin</h1>

<p><strong>We&#39;ve all wanted to see mojang adding a villager that can build houses and structures for us in minecraft since there are a lot of villagers professions, but unfortunately there&#39;s no one that can build, until now!</strong></p>

<h4><strong>this add-on adds a new block, items and a villager that can build for you!&nbsp;</strong></h4>

<p><strong>1-Building bench:</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://api.mcpedl.com/storage/submissions/157143/images/builder-villager-addon-by-aladdin_2.png" /></p>

<p>this block allows you to convert the villager to a builder villager by giving it to him, you can not give it to an unemployed villager or a baby villager, also you can not give it to a villlager at his bed time.</p>

<p><img src="https://api.mcpedl.com/storage/submissions/157143/images/builder-villager-addon-by-aladdin_3.png" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;also it can craft the necessary items that you may need to give the villager to construct a specific building like the blueprint &nbsp;item.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>you can craft it by doing the following recipe:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2-Blueprints and mechanics:</strong></p>

<p>you need an empty blueprint and some emeralds to be able to get a new blue print with the building info that you&#39;ve chosen, in the following image this building (small house) is 8 blocks tall and 7 blocks wide.</p>

<p><img src="https://api.mcpedl.com/storage/submissions/157143/images/builder-villager-addon-by-aladdin_5.png" /></p>

<p>you can creat the empty blueprint in the building bench like so:</p>

<p><img src="https://api.mcpedl.com/storage/submissions/157143/images/builder-villager-addon-by-aladdin_6.png" /></p>

<p>once you&#39;ve got the new blueprint with the building on it you can give it to the villager and then he will start following you to know where to build, when the villager is following you, you can give him a&nbsp;<strong>rotation blue print&nbsp;</strong>if you want to rotate the building</p>

<p>Warning!:&nbsp;The buildings will be facing East by default unless you rotate&nbsp;them</p>

<p><img src="https://api.mcpedl.com/storage/submissions/157143/images/builder-villager-addon-by-aladdin_7.png" /></p>

<p><img src="https://api.mcpedl.com/storage/submissions/157143/images/builder-villager-addon-by-aladdin_8.png" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;or you can give him an&nbsp;<strong>empty blueprint&nbsp;</strong>if you want him to cancel (he will only refund 10 emeralds).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>you can also give him a sample of wood to know what plank he should use (if you didn&#39;t give him a sample he will use oak planks).</p>

<p>in the following image i gave him birch wood:</p>

<p><img src="https://api.mcpedl.com/storage/submissions/157143/images/builder-villager-addon-by-aladdin_9.png" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>once you&#39;ve done choosing right click on the villager with an empty hand to make him start building:</p>

<p><img src="https://api.mcpedl.com/storage/submissions/157143/images/builder-villager-addon-by-aladdin_10.png" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>3-Construction zone item:</strong></p>

<p>this is our last item for this add-on wich is the construction zone item wich you can make only in the build bench, you don&#39;t have to make this in order to make the villager construct buildings, but it helps ALOT so you don&#39;t misslocate the building wich might be annoying until you use this item.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>you can right click with this item on the block you want the builder villager to stand on, and then he will go by him self to that block, if he doesn&#39;t go you can make him follow you to that block and when he get&#39;s close enough he will get locked on that block until he finish constructing the building (he must be on following mode).</p>

<p><img src="https://api.mcpedl.com/storage/submissions/157143/images/builder-villager-addon-by-aladdin_11.png" /></p>

<p><img src="https://api.mcpedl.com/storage/submissions/157143/images/builder-villager-addon-by-aladdin_12.png" /></p>

<p><img src="https://api.mcpedl.com/storage/submissions/157143/images/builder-villager-addon-by-aladdin_13.png" /></p>

<p>as you can see it lock the villager in so he doesn&#39;t move</p>
