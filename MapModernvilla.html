<h1>Modern Villa</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Modern house with all the amenities you can think of, convenient for you for all occasions, like swimming pool and helipad, say no to walls to help you have the coolest space. Language: Vietnamese</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>BUILDER: Tatsu69(is me)</p>

<p>EDIT VIDEO: Tatsu69(is me)</p>

<p>map contains create and build on PC (java) then use software to downgrade to mobile version (BE)</p>

<p>I would like to confirm that the above work was built and completed by myself, not stolen from anyone</p>

<p><br />
Specifically, the house has:</p>

<p>On the ground floor: an open kitchen that can be seen as soon as you enter the house, a large living room with a view of the beach, an art gallery, a swimming pool extending from the inside to the outside. &nbsp;Outdoors next is a coated bathroom</p>

<p>On the first floor, there is a large study room with a glass dome that helps to capture the most light, then a very large overhead courtyard that allows you to organize parties with friends, followed by a basic bathroom with &nbsp;waterfall bath</p>

<p>3rd floor is the bedroom, although it is not large, but the view around the elephant is wide</p>

<p>The last is the 4th floor: includes a small yard and helipad</p>
