<h1>Plantaica | Custom Survival Terrain | 640x640 |</h1>

<p>Plantacia is a large island that is home to the biggest and diverse fauna you will ever see.&nbsp;You can use it for anything, servers, survival playthrough and even more!&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Map size is: 640x640 blocks. It also has a wall and ceiling made of border blocks that surround it from the void.</p>

<p>As well as custom-made trees that I have added in world painter to make it large and natural</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Terrain is vast and large, each contains their own biomes&nbsp;</p>

<p>They are 4 main&nbsp;<strong>biomes&nbsp;</strong>that can be found around the&nbsp;<strong>map</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>they are mostly distributed around the edges of the map.</strong>&nbsp;And contain unique and largely diverse Trees!</p>

<p>Biomes include:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Plains - Located in the Western part of the map, has Tiny oak and birch trees</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Arctic - Located in the Southern part of the map, has Spruce Trees that are covered in snow along with ice caps at the edge</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Savanna - Located in the Northern part of the map, has Massive Bao Bab trees with hills</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Jungle - Located in the Eastern part of the Map, has Jungle Trees and vines</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Desert - Located in the Eastern part of the map, has palm trees made of jungle wood and beaches</strong></li>
</ul>
