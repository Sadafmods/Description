<p>In order to play you just need to enter the portal that is in the Lobby.</p>

<p>From there you will already be in a game, to start you must press the Skip button and the Game will begin.</p>

<p>You must press the jump button several times so that you can avoid the tonos that will appear throughout the game, which are completely random, you will not have a game the same as the previous one.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you lead to death, they will give you 2 items that are to go out to the lobby and another that is to restart the game.</p>

<p>In case the map gets bugged, open a button behind it that restarts the map, so the Bugs will be solved.</p>

<p>You can find the map in (.zip) and in (.mcworld) and you decide which one to download. You can support me by visiting my YouTube channel or visiting my page. :D</p>
