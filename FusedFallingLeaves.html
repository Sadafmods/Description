<h1>Fused Falling Leaves-Addon (Azalea &amp; Mangrove Leaves Update!)</h1>

<p>This small addon adds leaf particles which fall from trees, adding a lot of ambience to your worlds. The particles have some cool physics and animations and also interact with blocks. Except that there is a cool compatibility feature when used with my shaders.</p>

<p><strong>Texture:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The texture of the particles have color variations, size variations and orientation variations</p>

<p><strong>Distance:</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Leaf particles will randomly fall from any type of leaves within a 10 block radius.</p>

<p><strong>Physics:</strong></p>

<p>Leaf particles will slowly slide from the leaves and then fall onto the ground. Fallen leaves will stay on the block below them and if that block is broken, they will fall again. (Video linked below, showing it.)</p>

<p><strong>Lifetime:</strong></p>

<p>Particles have a life time of about 10 seconds to avoid lag.</p>

<p><strong>Extra shader feature:</strong></p>

<p>There will be extra free falling leaves to match the waving leaves-windy effect of My shaders. Compatible shaders:</p>

<p>Note: They dont break glass, the glass was broken by me to show their physics. The video is also a bit old and there have been some changes to the textures and falling speed.</p>

<p>&bull;Huge credits to Baalveer for helping out with the behavior of the particles.

<p>&bull;Credits to Dakonblackrose for the behavior of the free falling leaves(extra shader leaves) And the inspiration. Check out HIS falling leaves addon!:&nbsp;<a href="https://mcpedl.com/leaving/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutube.com/embed/%2F5EtNhbe4J0U" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://youtube.com/embed//5EtNhbe4J0U</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Information:</strong></p>

<p><strong>&bull;</strong>This addon does not require any experimental features and will be compatible with pretty much any addons/texture packs.</p>

<p>&bull;It may cause lag for super low end devices but it worked fine on a 2gb ram android. If it causes lag for you:</p>

<p>&bull;You can decrease the amount of particles from the Gear icon of the resource pack.</p>

<p>&bull;The particles are NOT entities, they are custom particles and can be summoned using the /particle command.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&bull;If you want the extra falling leaves for any other shader or any other resource pack then you can find a .zip file in the resource pack folder of the falling leaves addon. Just extract the folder inside of it in your desired shaders main folder/which contains the manifest.json</p>

<p>&bull;Sometimes behavior is not loaded in new worlds, mainly on Win 10 edition, and you wont be able to see any features. To fix it simply remove the behavior,go back, then apply it again or just try the addon in an already existing world.</p>
