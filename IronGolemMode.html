<h2>About Iron Golem Mode</h2>

<p>Here I&#39;ll be showing everything that was listed in &quot;Features&quot;. To begin, we have the half a heart of fall damage taken when dropped from any height. This means any fall damage you take, it will always only hurt half a heart. You could even drop from 1000 blocks up!</p>

<p>Next, if you didn&#39;t see the amount of health you get that was shown in the first image, here&#39;s a zoomed-in image of it. All Iron Golems have this much health in vanilla, meaning it&#39;s only fair you get it too!</p>

<p>Iron Golems can also breathe underwater in vanilla (although they do sink to the bottom and can&#39;t get back up). All that really changed here is the drowning bubbles being removed and the fact that you don&#39;t have to worry about drowning anymore.</p>

<p>And of course, you also get the skin of an Iron Golem. Now unlike my other addons where you stay in your same old skin, in this one you actually look like an Iron Golem and have the animations! This includes walking, crouching, swimming, etc.</p>

<p>The Iron Golem skin was not created by me, only the powers were. All I did was merge&nbsp;<a href="https://mcpedl.com/custom-iron-golem-pack/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>RuanV911&#39;s Custom Iron Golem</u></a>&nbsp;with my addon. GO GIVE THEM CREDIT!!</p>

<p>Lastly, we have the 4 extra damage per hit. This can&#39;t really be shown through an image, but you get the point. Every time you hit something, an additional 4 damage will be added. So if you&#39;re attacking with a diamond sword then you&#39;ll be doing about 11 damage instead of the regular 7.</p>

<h2>Extra Info:</h2>

<p>1. On&nbsp;<a href="https://mcpedl.com/custom-iron-golem-pack/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">RuanV911&#39;s Custom Iron Golem</a>&nbsp;there was nothing that said how you can&#39;t modify the addon unless you ask for permission. Because of that, I decided it&#39;ll be fine to merge their addon with mine. I gave full credit to them as well. Now, if RuanV911 wants their addon removed from mine (the Iron Golem powers) then just contact me about it on Discord, which can be found on my MCPEDL profile.</p>
